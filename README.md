# Weekly Challenge 1

For marketting agencies, the codebase should follow accessibility standards so the site is optimized for search engines.

Some divs have been replaced with appropriate names such as:
1. header for the header
2. nav for the navigation bar
3. section for the different sections
4. footer for the footer

Descriptions have been added to the different images via alt attributes.

Removed the different classes found under the .content because it was redundant.
Instead chose to use the .content class to create the formatting as opposed to having 3 separate ones doing the same thing.

Also removved the different classes found under .benefits for the same reason as .content.

Removed the header nav ul and placed it with header nav ul li as it will accomplish the same thing in less lines

Made sure appropriate classes are grouped up in the same area.
